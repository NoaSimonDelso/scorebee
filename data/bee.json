Following the scientific assessment of the status of natural resources in Europe (very poor and worsening), The NRL aims to integrate legal targets for stopping the situation to worsen. We are AGAINST this amendment because it removes the legal responsiblity of Member States to act, and any reference to the targets (therefore not making them legally binding). It also restricts all actions only to Natura 200 areas, instead of the totally of EU territory.",

          "description": "The Sustainable Use of Pesticide Regulation (SUR) has been a conflicting dossier within the European Parliament (chemically-based agriculture vs low-impact agriculture). The proposal would have transformed the existing Directive (2009/128/EC) into a Regulation which would be directly binding and uniformly applicable to all Member States, which is not the case today. The SUR established the ways to achieve pesticide reduction targets set up by the Green Deal. We are AGAINST here, because during the negociation procedure, the initial ambition of the SUR was watered down, making it even less stringent than the Directive. The final text put to vote was insufficient to answer to the pesticide reduction use and risk that Europe needs",
